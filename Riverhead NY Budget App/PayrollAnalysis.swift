//  PayrollAnalysis.swift
//  Riverhead NY Budget App
//
//  Two analyses over the bundled Gross Earnings records (payroll-records.json,
//  4,444 employee-year rows, 2018-2025):
//
//   1. OVERTIME & STAFFING — is a police rank staffed by premium rather than by
//      headcount? The intuitive test (overtime above 1.5x base salary) finds
//      nobody in Riverhead, and that result is reported rather than hidden: a
//      test that never fires is broken, not conservative. The real signal is at
//      rank level, because overtime is paid at 1.5x — so a rank's overtime
//      divided by 1.5 and then by its average base gives the number of full
//      positions' worth of straight-time hours the overtime represents.
//
//   2. SEPARATION PAY — median final-year overtime is about 0.93x a person's own
//      prior average, so overtime FALLS at the end of a career. The
//      end-of-career money is in the residual (gross minus base minus overtime),
//      which in a separation year is frequently many times the person's norm.
//
//  PROVENANCE, handled asymmetrically and on purpose:
//   • Rank figures use REPORTED titles only. A title carried back from another
//     year would let a since-promoted officer's current rank absorb overtime
//     earned at a lower one.
//   • A union derived from the row's own Pay Class is accepted: "PBA 8-40" names
//     the bargaining unit outright and is not a claim about a different year.
//
