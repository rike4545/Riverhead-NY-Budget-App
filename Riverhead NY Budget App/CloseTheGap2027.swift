//  The real 2027 constraint — the tax-cap gap — and the politically durable path
//  through a divided Town Board. Ported from the web edition's close-the-gap-2027.ts
//  so the three platforms tell the same story.
//
//  Two different "gaps" appear in the 2027 planning views and they measure
//  different things:
//    • payroll-pressure gap ($936,727) — the recurring cost of standing still.
//    • cap-piercing gap    ($2,757,133) — how far the projected 2027 levy
//      overshoots what NY's 2% property-tax cap allows. This is the number that
//      forces a political decision.
