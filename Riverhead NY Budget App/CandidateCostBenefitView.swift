//  CandidateCostBenefitView.swift
//  Riverhead NY Budget App
//
//  A neutral, even-handed cost–benefit look at every stated platform plank in the
//  November 3, 2026 Town Supervisor race — each with a benefit, a cost, and a
//  tradeoff, tied to the Town's own budget figures — plus a non-partisan fiscal
//  view of the Town's repeated tax increases. Companion to CandidateWatchView
//  (which reports each candidate in their own words). Ported from the web edition.
//
//  This is analysis of stated positions, weighed evenly — not an endorsement or a
//  prediction.
